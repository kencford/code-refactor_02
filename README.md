# Homework 1 - Code Refactor
## Description
A marketing agency has hired me to refactor the code for an existing site in order to make it more accessible. These tasks have been completed:
```
The source code uses semantic HTML elements.
The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
Icon and image elements have have accessible alt attributes.
Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
The title element is concise and descriptive.
```
## User Experience

The look and feel of the webpage remains unchanged. A screenshot of it is shown below:
